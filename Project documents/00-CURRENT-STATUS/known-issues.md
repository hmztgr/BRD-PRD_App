## üî¥ **CRITICAL ISSUES** (Launch Blockers)

### **Issue #001: API 404 Errors - Project Creation Endpoints**
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Status**: UNRESOLVED
- **Discovered**: January 5, 2025 during live testing

**Description:**
Project creation and session management APIs returning 404 errors, preventing proper project persistence.

**Error Details:**
```
ERROR: Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
URL: http://localhost:3001/api/projects/undefined/session/save
```

**Impact:**
- Users cannot save project progress
- Session resume functionality broken
- Advanced mode project persistence failing

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- URL parameter `projectId=undefined` indicates parameter passing issues
- API routing not properly handling dynamic project IDs
- Possible mismatch between frontend parameter names and backend expectations

**Reproduction Steps:**
1. Create new document in Advanced Mode
2. Start chat conversation
3. Check browser console for 404 errors
4. Observe `projectId=undefined` in URL

**Workaround:** None available - core functionality affected

**Priority:** HIGH - Blocks project persistence

### **Issue #002: Payment Processing Disabled**
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Status**: BLOCKED (External Dependency)
- **Discovered**: Expected based on PRD documentation

**Description:**
Payment processing functionality disabled pending Saudi business registration approval.

**Impact:**
- Users cannot upgrade to paid plans
- Subscription changes not possible
- Revenue generation blocked

**Root Cause:** 
Business registration approval required for Stripe/Moyasar activation

**Workaround:** 
Users can use free tier and professional UI is ready for activation

**Priority:** HIGH - Blocks monetization

### **Issue #003: Password Reset Not Implemented**
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Status**: UNRESOLVED
- **Discovered**: January 5, 2025 during auth testing

**Description:**
Password reset functionality missing despite "Forgot password?" link being present.

**Impact:**
- Users locked out of accounts if they forget passwords
- Poor user experience for account recovery
- Customer support burden

**Evidence:**
- Link exists at `/en/auth/forgot-password`
- Click behavior not tested (likely non-functional)

**Workaround:** Manual admin intervention required

**Priority:** HIGH - Critical UX feature

## üü° **MODERATE ISSUES** (Should Fix Before Launch)

### **Issue #004: Document Generation Mode Switching**
- **Severity**: MODERATE
- **Status**: UNRESOLVED
- **Discovered**: January 5, 2025 during document generation testing

**Description:**
Selecting "Standard Mode" in generation modal switches to Advanced Mode instead.

**Reproduction Steps:**
1. Click "New Document" from dashboard
2. Modal appears with Standard/Advanced options
3. Click "Select" for Standard Mode
4. Advanced Mode loads instead

**Impact:**
- User confusion about feature selection
- Unexpected interface complexity for users wanting simple mode

**Console Output:**
```
LOG: Mode mismatch detected
```

**Workaround:** Advanced Mode is fully functional

**Priority:** MEDIUM - UX confusion but not blocking

### **Issue #005: Admin Interface Access Restricted**
- **Severity**: MODERATE
- **Status**: BY DESIGN (But needs documentation)
- **Discovered**: January 5, 2025 during admin testing

**Description:**
Admin interface redirects to login with "admin-access-required" message. Current test user lacks admin permissions.

**Impact:**
- Admin functionality cannot be tested
- Admin features verification incomplete
- Unknown admin interface completeness

**Workaround:** Need admin-level test account

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Testing limitation
