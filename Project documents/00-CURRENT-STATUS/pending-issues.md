## ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL ISSUES** (UNRESOLVED)

### **Issue #038: Database Connection Pool Exhaustion Causing Mock Data Fallback**
- **Category**: Database Performance & Infrastructure
- **Priority**: CRITICAL
- **Status**: PARTIALLY MITIGATED (Connection pool optimized, frontend fix needed)
- **Reported**: August 31, 2025

**Description:**
Admin dashboard and other API endpoints are experiencing severe database connection pool exhaustion, causing database queries to fail and fallback to mock data. The issue causes extremely slow page loads (15-20+ seconds) and unreliable data display.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Frontend making multiple concurrent requests (6+ times) to same API endpoints
- Each API request executes 4 database queries via Promise.all()
- Results in 24+ simultaneous database connections being requested
- Connection pool exhaustion occurs even with 20 connections configured
- Failed queries trigger mock data fallback in API routes

**Current Behavior:**
1. User navigates to admin dashboard
2. Frontend makes 6+ concurrent requests to `/api/admin/dashboard`
3. Each request attempts 4 database queries simultaneously
4. Connection pool gets exhausted (even at 20 connections)
5. Database queries timeout and fail
6. API falls back to mock data instead of real metrics
7. Page load times: 15-20+ seconds on localhost, 1-2+ minutes on production

**Expected Behavior:**
- Single API request per page load
- Real database data displayed
- Page loads in <2 seconds
- Reliable database connectivity

**Temporary Mitigation Applied:**
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.jmfkzfmripuzfspijndq:Kx9KWdGOlh7WgEuT@aws-1-eu-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres?connection_limit=15&pool_timeout=8&connect_timeout=8&statement_timeout=6000"
```

**Required Long-term Solution:**
1. **Frontend Optimization**: Prevent duplicate API calls on same page
2. **API Request Deduplication**: Implement request caching/deduplication
3. **Connection Pool Monitoring**: Add logging for connection usage
4. **Query Optimization**: Review and optimize database queries
5. **Error Handling**: Improve fallback strategies beyond mock data

**Priority Justification:**
CRITICAL - Application is essentially unusable for admin functions, showing fake data instead of real business metrics, and taking 15-20+ seconds per page load.

### **Issue #037: ACCOUNT_MANAGER Separate Interface Required**
- **Category**: Admin Interface & Authorization
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Reported**: August 31, 2025

**Description:**
ACCOUNT_MANAGER users should have a completely separate interface from the main admin panel. They should NOT have access to the /admin pages but should have their own dedicated account management interface.

**Current Behavior:**
- ACCOUNT_MANAGER users currently have access to main admin interface
- This provides more access than intended for their role

**Required Changes:**
1. **Create separate page/interface for ACCOUNT_MANAGER role**
2. **Remove ACCOUNT_MANAGER access from main admin interface**
3. **Design appropriate permissions and functionality for account management tasks**
4. **Implement dedicated routing for account management features**

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/lib/admin-auth.ts` - Remove admin access for ACCOUNT_MANAGER
- Create new account management interface components
- Add new routing for account management pages

## ðŸŸ¢ **BUSINESS POLICY ISSUES** (UNRESOLVED)

### **Issue #005: Problematic FAQ Content**
- **Category**: Business Policy & Content
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Reported**: August 19, 2025

**Description:**
Several FAQ items contain problematic content that could create business issues or provide misleading information.

#### **Sub-issue 5A: Refund Policy Risk**
**Current Content:**
"Do you offer refunds? We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for all paid plans. Contact support if you're not satisfied."

**Problem:**
- Users could generate documents then request refunds
- Creates potential for abuse of service
- High business risk with AI usage costs

**Recommended Action:**
- Remove money-back guarantee
- Replace with different satisfaction policy
- Consider usage-based refund limitations

#### **Sub-issue 5B: Misleading Token Explanation**
**Current Content:**
"What are tokens? Tokens measure AI usage for document generation. Typically, 1,000 tokens = 1 standard business document. Your token limit resets monthly."

**Problem:**
- Misleading conversion rate (1,000 tokens â‰  1 document reliably)
- Oversimplified explanation of token usage
- Could lead to customer disappointment

**Recommended Action:**
- Either provide accurate, detailed token explanation
- Or remove the specific conversion ratio
- Focus on token limits per tier instead

#### **Sub-issue 5C: Downgrade Policy Inaccuracy**
**Current Content:**
"Can I upgrade or downgrade anytime? Yes! You can change your plan anytime through your account settings. Changes take effect immediately with prorated billing."

**Problem:**
- Downgrade should not take effect immediately
- Should start at next billing period to prevent abuse
- Upgrade immediate is fine, downgrade should be delayed

**Recommended Action:**
- Update policy: "Upgrades take effect immediately. Downgrades take effect at your next billing period."
- Implement proper downgrade timing in billing system

**Impact:**
- High business risk with current refund policy
- Customer confusion with token explanation
- Billing system complexity with immediate downgrades
