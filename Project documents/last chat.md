● ✅ Successfully synced your local and remote work! Here's what happened:      

  1. Safely stashed your local changes with a descriptive message
  2. Fetched the latest changes from the remote repository
  3. Created a backup branch (backup-master-[timestamp]) of your original state
  4. Switched to development branch and pulled the latest remote changes       
  5. Applied your stashed changes back onto the development branch

  Current Status:

  - You're now on the development branch, up to date with remote
  - Your local changes are preserved and applied:
    - .claude/settings.local.json (modified)
    - brd-prd-app/.gitignore (modified)
    - Admin feature/Admin-Current-Status-Comparison.md (new file)
  - A backup branch exists if you need to reference your original state

  What you can do next:

  - Review and commit your current changes: git add . && git commit -m "your message"
  - Continue working on the development branch
  - Your backup branch is available if needed: git checkout backup-master-[timestamp]

  Your work is now safely integrated without losing any progress! 🎉
