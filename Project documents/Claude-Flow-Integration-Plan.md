### Phase 4: Advanced Document Generation
**Objective**: Transform document generation into multi-agent workflow

**Features**:
- Multi-agent document creation with specialized sections
- Document validation and improvement suggestions
- Iterative document refinement using multiple agents
- Collaborative review system with AI feedback

**Tasks**:
- Replace current document generation with multi-agent workflow
- Implement document section specialization
- Add iterative improvement capabilities
- Create quality validation system

### Phase 5: Integration & Optimization
**Objective**: Optimize performance and ensure reliability

**Features**:
- Comprehensive fallback system (Claude-Flow → OpenAI → Gemini)
- Usage analytics and cost optimization
- Admin dashboard for monitoring agent performance
- Caching system for common research queries

**Tasks**:
- Implement robust fallback mechanisms
- Add comprehensive monitoring and analytics
