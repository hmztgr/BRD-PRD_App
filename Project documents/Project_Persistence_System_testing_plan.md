# Project Persistence System - Comprehensive Testing Plan

**Project:** BRD-PRD App Advanced Mode Session Persistence  
**Environment:** Development (localhost:3001)  
**Database:** jmfkzfmripuzfspijndq (Supabase Development)  
**Testing Tools:** Playwright MCP, Supabase MCP, Context7 MCP, Claude-Flow --sparc  
**Created:** September 2, 2025  

## Overview

This document provides a complete testing plan for the Project Persistence System that enables Advanced Mode users to save, resume, and manage multi-stage business planning sessions. The system includes project management, auto-save, session restoration, and a dashboard widget.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Database Setup (CRITICAL - Must be done first)

**Execute Migration Script:**
```sql
-- File Location: /brd-prd-app/project-migration.sql
-- Execute via Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor

-- This script creates 4 new tables:
-- 1. projects - Main project entities
-- 2. project_sessions - Session management  
-- 3. conversation_summaries - AI-powered summarization
-- 4. project_files - File attachments
-- Plus adds projectId foreign keys to existing tables
```

**Verification Steps:**
```bash
cd /brd-prd-app
npx prisma db pull
npx prisma generate
npm run dev
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

**Database URLs (already configured):**
- `DATABASE_URL` - Transaction pooler for runtime
- `DATABASE_DIRECT_URL` - Direct connection for migrations
- Development database: `jmfkzfmripuzfspijndq`

### 3. User Account Setup
- Login with: `admin@smartdocs.ai` (Professional tier)
- Ensure clean state or document existing projects

## Testing Architecture

### MCP Tools Usage:

1. **Playwright MCP** - UI automation and interaction testing
2. **Supabase MCP** - Database verification and data integrity checks
3. **Context7 MCP** - Documentation and API reference verification (if needed)
4. **Claude-Flow --sparc** - Structured test execution and reporting

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Testing

### 1.1 Database Schema Verification

**Using Supabase MCP:**
```sql
-- Verify all tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('projects', 'project_sessions', 'conversation_summaries', 'project_files');

-- Check foreign key relationships
SELECT tc.constraint_name, tc.table_name, kcu.column_name, ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' AND tc.table_name LIKE '%project%';

-- Verify projectId columns added to existing tables
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name IN ('documents', 'conversations', 'research_requests') 
AND column_name = 'projectId';
```

**Expected Results:**
- 4 new tables exist with correct schema
- Foreign key constraints properly established
- projectId columns added to existing tables

### 1.2 API Endpoints Health Check
