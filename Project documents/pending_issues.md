## 🔴 **CRITICAL ISSUES**

### **RESOLVED: Issue #001 - Language Toggle Logout Bug**
- **Resolution Date**: August 24, 2025
- **Resolved By**: Claude Code Assistant  
- **Solution**: Fixed language toggle navigation to preserve current page context and maintain authentication
- **Testing**: Language toggle now preserves user session and redirects to equivalent page in new language
- **Status**: CLOSED

**Description:**
When user is logged into the Arabic dashboard and presses the language toggle button, the system logs them out and redirects to the English homepage instead of keeping them logged in and switching to the English dashboard.

**Expected Behavior:**
- User should remain logged in when switching languages
- Should redirect to equivalent page in new language (Arabic dashboard → English dashboard)
- Session should be preserved across language changes

**Current Behavior:**
- User gets logged out
- Redirected to English homepage
- Must log in again to access dashboard

**Technical Notes:**
- Issue likely in language switcher implementation in header component
- May be related to session handling during locale changes
- Affects user experience significantly

**Impact:**
- Major user experience disruption
- Could discourage bilingual usage
- Breaks expected internationalization behavior

### **Issue #002: Yearly Pricing Display Format**
- **Category**: UI/UX - Pricing Display
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Reported**: August 19, 2025

**Description:**
Yearly pricing display format is confusing and doesn't clearly show monthly equivalent pricing.

**Current Display:**
- Professional: "$34.20/year Save $11.40 (25% off)"
- Business: Similar format without monthly breakdown
- Enterprise: Similar format without monthly breakdown

**Desired Display Format:**
- Professional: "2.85/month (total payment $34.20/year) Save $11.40 (25% off)"
- Business: "[monthly]/month (total payment $[yearly]/year) Save $[savings] (25% off)"
- Enterprise: "[monthly]/month (total payment $[yearly]/year) Save $[savings] (25% off)"

**Impact:**
- Users may not understand actual monthly cost when paying yearly
- Pricing comparison becomes difficult
- Could affect conversion rates

---

### **Issue #003: Incorrect Savings Percentage Display**
- **Category**: UI/UX - Pricing Information
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Reported**: August 19, 2025

**Description:**
The pricing page shows "Save 15%" near the monthly/yearly toggle, but actual savings appear to be 25%.

**Current Display:**
- Toggle area shows "save 15%"

**Actual Calculation:**
- Savings appear to be 25% based on pricing structure
- Display should match actual savings percentage

**Required Action:**
- Verify actual savings percentage calculation
- Update display to show correct percentage (likely "Save 25%")

**Impact:**
- Misleading information to customers
- Could affect trust and purchasing decisions
- Inconsistent pricing messaging

### **Issue #004: Document Limits Placement and Clarity**
- **Category**: UI/UX - Information Architecture
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Reported**: August 19, 2025

**Description:**
Document limits information is displayed separately from token limits, making pricing structure less clear.

**Current Display:**
- Separate bullets for document limits: "Limited to 3-6 documents per month", "Up to 65-130 documents per month"
- Separate bullets for token limits: "50K tokens per month", "200K tokens per month"

**Desired Display:**
- Combined format: "50K tokens per month (3-6 documents)", "200K tokens per month (65-130 documents)"
- Or group related information together

**Impact:**
- Information architecture could be clearer
- Easier comparison between tiers
- Better user understanding of limits

### **Issue #005: Problematic FAQ Content**
- **Category**: Business Policy & Content
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Reported**: August 19, 2025

**Description:**
Several FAQ items contain problematic content that could create business issues or provide misleading information.

#### **Sub-issue 5A: Refund Policy Risk**
**Current Content:**
"Do you offer refunds? We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for all paid plans. Contact support if you're not satisfied."

**Problem:**
- Users could generate documents then request refunds
- Creates potential for abuse of service
- High business risk with AI usage costs

**Recommended Action:**
- Remove money-back guarantee
- Replace with different satisfaction policy
- Consider usage-based refund limitations

#### **Sub-issue 5B: Misleading Token Explanation**
**Current Content:**
"What are tokens? Tokens measure AI usage for document generation. Typically, 1,000 tokens = 1 standard business document. Your token limit resets monthly."

**Problem:**
- Misleading conversion rate (1,000 tokens ≠ 1 document reliably)
- Oversimplified explanation of token usage
- Could lead to customer disappointment

**Recommended Action:**
- Either provide accurate, detailed token explanation
- Or remove the specific conversion ratio
- Focus on token limits per tier instead

#### **Sub-issue 5C: Downgrade Policy Inaccuracy**
**Current Content:**
"Can I upgrade or downgrade anytime? Yes! You can change your plan anytime through your account settings. Changes take effect immediately with prorated billing."

**Problem:**
- Downgrade should not take effect immediately
- Should start at next billing period to prevent abuse
- Upgrade immediate is fine, downgrade should be delayed

**Recommended Action:**
- Update policy: "Upgrades take effect immediately. Downgrades take effect at your next billing period."
- Implement proper downgrade timing in billing system

**Impact:**
- High business risk with current refund policy
- Customer confusion with token explanation
- Billing system complexity with immediate downgrades
