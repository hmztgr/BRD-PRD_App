<answer>
great, i see most issues fixed i have few points
- check "View Referral Dashboard" button style, other buttons like "New Document" & "Create First Document" and all the fixed buttons should look like the "View Referral Dashboard" button, also in my in my document page same 2 buttons change it to be like "View Referral Dashboard" button, same in settings page "Save Changes", and "Upgrade Plan" buttons change it to be like "View Referral Dashboard" button, (buttons in pricing page actually looks great keep those as it is)
- in new document page i see it has arabic translation but the AI text and the title are still in english "AI Document Assistant
Hello Hamza Hashim! I'm here to help you create professional business documents. Tell me about your project idea and I'll ask clarifying questions to ensure we capture all the important details.

16:46" also in the typing area it says "tell me about your project idea...", and "Press Enter to send ‚Ä¢ Shift+Enter for new line" are in english while i am in the arabic interface 


i noticed issues were there but i didnt notice or didnt report it earlier
- in pricing page at the top under the "Choose Your Plan/ Select the perfect plan for your document generation needs/ MonthlyYearlySave 15%" area it has white color which is very disturbing compared to the black background so change the color to something less light 
- in pricing page similar issue with the area under "Frequently Asked Questions" area its too white change it to something with less light
 </answer>

i have 2 new concerns i would like to dicuess 



this plan looks great but i have 2 adjusments 
  1. i used the "Market Research Assistant: Web research with user validation loops" in my example just as an example but it should do this with every step require gathering data
  2. this part
  "
  Enhance existing /documents/new page with:                                                                             ‚îÇ     
     - Dashboard Modal: Add popup on "Create New Document" with "Simple" vs "Advanced (Beta)" options

     - Document upload dropzone area
     - Generated files/folders sidebar
     - Progress roadmap tracker
     - Research findings panel

  in the documents/new?mode=advanced page under "Generated Files" i see those buttons "Preview", "Download", and "Share" in each file genrated they are great but since those cards are kinda small remove the text and keep only the icons and place those texts as tooltip when user hover over the buttons 


i see that you just said 
 " ‚óè Perfect! I can see that when visiting /documents/new without a mode parameter, it defaults to Standard Mode and doesn't show a mode selection popup.
  This means all the "New Document" buttons are working correctly - they go to the new document page where users can create documents or switch modes using the "Switch to Advanced" button."
  but users without registered accounts shouldnt be able to reach this page 




- Fixed research findings card popup behavior now it send the user to the progress tab - is this how it should work? i think its not supposed to work like that 
- Created standard mode with advanced mode UI - almost fixed still standard mode doesnt have Multi-document generation support it should be available in both standard and advanced
- Fixed OpenAI quota exceeded error - advanced mode chat AI still doesnt work but in standard it works i think thats because we havent finished the advanced logic yet
- Fixed incorrect standard mode description - still shows "Generate Document
Standard mode provides multi-document suite generation based on your conversation. For advanced features like intelligent planning and research tools, upgrade to Advanced Mode.

Generate Single Document"
-Added mode selection popup to all new document buttons - not fixed still only one button shows mode selection, other buttons redirect to standard mode directly 


  

  while testing i noticed few new issues document those in @Project documents\pending_issues.md then fix them
  - in the Create New Document page under the "Generated Files" inside the files cards i see statments like "BRD", 
"Completed", "PRD", "Generating...", etc those are great but since teh area is kinda small sometimes it goes out of the card borders how do yu suggest we fix this issue? i like the idea so i would like to keep it but we need to make it look better
- in the "Advanced mode chat" when the chat gets longer i cant scroll to see earlier chat 
- in the /documents the "New Document" button and "Create First Document" (you can find this button only if the user never created any documents yet) both those buttons lead to the standard mode chat need to be fixed to show the generation mode modal


update @@Project documents\pending_issues.md

fixed issues
Fixed authentication bypass 


new issues
- when i logout i get an error "This site can‚Äôt be reached"











i would like you to add this to the @"Project documents\Payment-Options-Comparison.md"  and is it even worth using stripe atlas for international payments? is there any benifits from using stripe atlas if we used Moyasar and/or Paylink? also can you make a .md and fill it with this
  1. find the API pricing for those models claude opus 4, claude sonnet 4, GPT-5, GPT-4 and gemini pro and map it to the pricing in our app (ignore fallback always assume the main model AI).
  2. suggest pricing strategy for each product based on those models API pricing and  payment methods payout. (percentage and fixed)
  3.  create scenarios assuming different sales numbers, keep in mind referal rewards reducing sales initially probably, do this step for current products prices, also keep in mind the token usage per document and  make sure the price makes sense per document, and suggested products prices.
  4.  also create a table comparing the revenue, cost and profit for each scenario.
  5. create price-impact and margin-impact scenarios and compare them.
  6. if possible compare those with competitor pricing and margin and get to a conclusion of which pricing is better and why.

here are some refrences we researched earlier but i want you to use the internet to confirm the pricing of the models, competitors prices, competitors services, and the payment methods payout.
