great, i see most issues fixed i have few points
- check "View Referral Dashboard" button style, other buttons like "New Document" & "Create First Document" and all the fixed buttons should look like the "View Referral Dashboard" button, also in my in my document page same 2 buttons change it to be like "View Referral Dashboard" button, same in settings page "Save Changes", and "Upgrade Plan" buttons change it to be like "View Referral Dashboard" button, (buttons in pricing page actually looks great keep those as it is)
- in new document page i see it has arabic translation but the AI text and the title are still in english "AI Document Assistant
Hello Hamza Hashim! I'm here to help you create professional business documents. Tell me about your project idea and I'll ask clarifying questions to ensure we capture all the important details.

16:46" also in the typing area it says "tell me about your project idea...", and "Press Enter to send • Shift+Enter for new line" are in english while i am in the arabic interface 


i noticed issues were there but i didnt notice or didnt report it earlier
- in pricing page at the top under the "Choose Your Plan/ Select the perfect plan for your document generation needs/ MonthlyYearlySave 15%" area it has white color which is very disturbing compared to the black background so change the color to something less light 
- in pricing page similar issue with the area under "Frequently Asked Questions" area its too white change it to something with less light
