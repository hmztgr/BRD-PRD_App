# Analytics System Design for Admin Interface

## Overview
This document outlines the design and implementation of comprehensive analytics, monitoring, and reporting features for the admin interface.

## Key Data Sources & Metrics Identified

### 1. User Analytics
Based on the `User`, `UsageHistory`, and `Payment` models:

**User Growth Metrics:**
- New user signups over time
- User activation rates (email verified)
- User retention rates by cohort
- Subscription tier distribution
- Churn analysis

**Usage Pattern Metrics:**
- Token consumption trends
- Document generation patterns
- AI model usage distribution
- Feature adoption rates
- Session analytics

### 2. System Monitoring
Based on `ContactRequest`, `SupportTicket`, `Feedback`, and system models:

**Support Metrics:**
- Contact request volume and response times
- Support ticket resolution rates
- Feedback sentiment analysis
- System health indicators
- Error rates and performance metrics

### 3. Revenue Analytics
Based on `Payment`, `User` subscription data, and Stripe integration:

**Financial Metrics:**
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
- Churn rate and its impact on revenue
- Subscription upgrade/downgrade patterns
- Payment success rates

### 4. Content & Document Analytics
Based on `Document`, `DocumentVersion`, `Template`, and `Conversation` models:

**Content Metrics:**
- Document creation trends
- Template usage statistics
- Collaboration patterns
- Document type popularity
- AI model performance comparison

## Recommended Technology Stack

### Chart Libraries
**Primary Choice: Recharts**
- React-native charting library
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Lightweight and performant
- Composable components
- Good integration with Tailwind CSS

**Alternative: Chart.js with react-chartjs-2**
- More chart types available
- Better for complex visualizations
- Larger bundle size

### Data Visualization Components
- **Line Charts**: User growth, revenue trends, usage patterns
- **Bar Charts**: Feature adoption, document types, subscription tiers
- **Pie/Donut Charts**: User distribution, payment methods, feedback categories
- **Area Charts**: Cumulative metrics, token usage over time
- **Heatmaps**: User activity patterns, geographic distribution
- **KPI Cards**: Key metrics summary
- **Tables**: Detailed data listings with sorting and filtering

## Database Query Strategy

### Real-time vs Batch Analytics
- **Real-time**: Current active users, system health, critical alerts
- **Batch/Cached**: Historical trends, complex aggregations, monthly reports
- **Hybrid**: Daily/hourly summaries for performance balance

### Query Optimization
- Create database views for complex aggregations
- Use time-based partitioning for large tables
- Implement caching strategy for frequently accessed data
- Use database indexes for common query patterns

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### User Growth KPIs
- Daily/Monthly Active Users (DAU/MAU)
- User Acquisition Cost (UAC)
- Monthly Signup Growth Rate
- Email Verification Rate
- Time to First Value (document generation)

### Revenue KPIs
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) Growth
- Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)
- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
- Churn Rate and Revenue Churn

### System Health KPIs

## Security & Privacy Considerations

### Data Privacy
- Implement proper data anonymization
- Respect user privacy settings
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- Secure data aggregation without exposing individual user details

### Access Control
- Role-based access to different analytics levels
- Audit logging for admin activities
- Secure API endpoints with proper authentication
- Rate limiting for analytics APIs

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 1**: Implement basic user analytics and revenue dashboards
2. **Phase 2**: Add system monitoring and health metrics
