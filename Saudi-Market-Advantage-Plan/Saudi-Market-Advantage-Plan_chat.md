1st of all at this point its not just BRD/PRD app its more like full business plan am i correct?

well my intent was that if the user has an idea but doesnt have enough info to create a proper business documents the app would guide the user step by step to collect the info and create the documents and if the user has an idea with enough info the app would study the user idea and create a proper business documents

since i already think the current app performance is not bad so i think we shouldnt touch the current setup instead what we can do is in the dashbord page when the user click "create new document" before he gets directed to the /document/new he gets a pop up page giving him 2 options something like "simple general document generation" and "advanced document generation (beta)" or something like that and explain shortly what are the diffrances between the 2 options, "simple general document generation" the app would do exacly what it does now no changes, "advanced document generation (beta)" the app would use this new iterative system we are developing now "explain how iterative method work, the app ask questions the user fill in info then the app adjust according to those answers etc" (since currently we are working on Saudi Arabia focused only it should be mentioned in the explanation that it can work for any country but its more advanced for the Saudi Arabia market or something like that) and if the user choose the advanced option but the business isnt in Saudi Arabia the app should use the same logic but research and replace saudi specific regulations with the user country.

for example 

- example 1
    -- the user pressed "create new document" and "advanced document generation (beta)"
    -- the user gets directed to the new document chat page with the advanced document generation (beta) system logic 
    -- the user type something like "I would like to build a device that can measures human tempreture and sell it"
    -- (since the user didnt specificly mention in which country they would like to start this idea the app should ask the user in which country do you plan on starting this idea? or something like that)
    -- the user says Saudi Arabia
    -- (since the user answered "Saudi Arabia" the app will use the Saudi Arabia logic) the app would think of the user idea and think what documents would be needed to achieve this idea for example the app answer something like do you have case study, BRD, PRD, and/or this and that etc...

    -- the user says i have the main concept and share the main concept for the sake of the example lets say it says this device will use XYZ technology in a specific way to achieve his idea

    -- the app would understand his concept and think how to implement this idea, what kind of documents required? for example the app think it needs those 3 documents
        + case study
        + BRD
        + PRD

    -- then the app start asking the user questions to fill in the required info to be able to implement the @Saudi-Market-Advantage-Plan\  logic on the user idea. (the user should be able to save progress and come back to proceed on different times, to able to do that the app should create a plan roadmap file and mark every completed step, the user should be able to see this plan roadmap file) 

    -- for example the app at a point where it needs market research so the app would search the internet and provide what data they can find and decide is this data enough to make market research or not and ask the user to confirm the app findings or manually research the market and return to the app with thier findings, suggest to guide the user if they need help with that.

    -- the user says yes i need help with market research 

    -- the app think and suggest a plan on how to research the market 

    -- the user save the progress then later gets back with data 

    -- the app would read the data submited by the user and decide if its enough data or missing important data, if its enough it would save it then ask next questions needed for the business documents if its not enough or missing important data it would ask the user if they can provide this missing data if they said they cant or want to skip this part then the app would ask next questions needed for the business documents otherwise it wait for the user filling in missing data

    -- the app repaets those steps untill all required data collected and create a summery of all teh data collected ann it would ask the user if they have other info they would like to add, if not the app starts creating the documents (curently the app can only create one document from what i saw but it should be able to create multiple documents)




- example 2
    -- the user pressed "create new document" and "advanced document generation (beta)"
    -- the user gets directed to the new document chat page with the advanced document generation (beta) system logic 
    -- the user type something like "I would like to build a device that can measures human tempreture and sell it"
    -- (since the user didnt specificly mention in which country they would like to start this idea the app should ask the user in which country do you plan on starting this idea? or something like that)
    -- the user says any other country than Saudi Arabia
    -- (since the user answered a different country than Saudi Arabia the app should research and create a logic similar to the Saudi Arabia logic that comply with the user mentioned country customes and regulations) the app would think of the user idea and think what documents would be needed to achieve this idea for example the app answer something like do you have case study, BRD, PRD, and/or this and that etc...
    -- from this point the app should work the same as example 1 but following the country customes and regulations mentioned by the user in every step


to be able to perform this we will need to make some adjusments to our current app like
    - the user should be able to upload documents
    - the app should be able to read and understand those documents (searchable and non searchable documents)
    - in the new document chat interface we will need 2 new sections
        + an area for the folders and files created by the app
        + an area for the uploaded documents

‚óè Excellent clarification! Now I understand your vision completely. You're right - this isn't just BRD/PRD generation anymore,
  it's a comprehensive AI-powered business planning platform. Let me break down what you're describing:

  Your Vision: Advanced Iterative Business Planning System

  Core Concept

  - Keep current app unchanged (simple option)
  - Add new advanced system that guides users through comprehensive business planning
  - Saudi intelligence is just the "special expertise" for Saudi Arabia
  - Works for any country by researching that country's requirements dynamically

  User Journey You're Describing

  1. Dashboard Choice: "Simple" vs "Advanced (Beta)" document generation
  2. Country Detection: App asks which country if not specified
  3. Document Planning: App analyzes idea and determines needed documents (Case Study + BRD + PRD, etc.)
  4. Iterative Data Collection: App guides user through step-by-step information gathering
  5. Research Assistant: App does market research, regulatory research, competitive analysis
  6. Progress Tracking: Roadmap file showing completed/pending steps
  7. Multi-Document Output: Generate complete business plan documentation set

  Technical Requirements You've Identified

  New Capabilities Needed:
  - Document upload and parsing (PDF, Word, images, etc.)
  - Progress saving/resuming with roadmap tracking
  - Multi-document generation capability
  - Dynamic country research (not just Saudi)
  - Interactive chat with file management interface
  - Market research and validation assistance

  Interface Changes:
  - New chat interface with:
    - Document upload area
    - Generated files/folders section
    - Progress roadmap display
    - Research findings section

  The Saudi-Market-Advantage-Plan's Role

  The Saudi intelligence we planned becomes the expert knowledge base for when users choose Saudi Arabia, but the system
  architecture supports any country through:
  - Dynamic regulatory research
  - Cultural adaptation
  - Market analysis
  - Compliance requirements discovery

  This is actually a much more ambitious and valuable platform than we originally planned - it's essentially an AI business
  consultant that creates comprehensive business plans through guided conversation and research.

  Would you like me to create a plan for how to implement this advanced iterative business planning system, building on the
  Saudi intelligence framework we already developed?

> yes but before you do that i would like to clarify in the "Interface Changes:
    - New chat interface with:
      - Document upload area
      - Generated files/folders section
      - Progress roadmap display
      - Research findings section" i meant within the same document/new page that we already have where the user chat with the      
  AI not a new page
